<i>Final project within subject Development technologies of intelligent solutions</i>

This is a implementation of Neural Style Transfer algorithm proposed by [Gatys in 2015](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.06576.pdf). Method is implemented using Pytorch. Style transfer is used for images, videos and also for combining styles and transferring them to image.
